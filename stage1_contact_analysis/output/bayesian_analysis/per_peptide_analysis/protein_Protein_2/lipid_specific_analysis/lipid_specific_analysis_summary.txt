===== Target Lipid Effects on Specific Lipid Types =====

Lipid Type: CHOL
  Effect Size (β): 1.895
  95% HDI: [1.615, 2.162]
  Probability of positive effect: 1.000
  Interpretation: Strong evidence that target lipid increases contact with this lipid type.

Lipid Type: DIPC
  Effect Size (β): -1.440
  95% HDI: [-2.384, -0.488]
  Probability of negative effect: 0.997
  Interpretation: Strong evidence that target lipid decreases contact with this lipid type.

Lipid Type: DPSM
  Effect Size (β): 0.278
  95% HDI: [0.197, 0.354]
  Probability of positive effect: 1.000
  Interpretation: Strong evidence that target lipid increases contact with this lipid type.

Lipid Type: DOPS
  Effect Size (β): -0.000
  95% HDI: [-0.000, 0.000]
  Probability of negative effect: 0.499
  Interpretation: Weak evidence for target lipid effect on this lipid type.


===== Overall Conclusions =====
Strong positive effects: 2 lipid types
Strong negative effects: 1 lipid types

Target lipid shows differential effects on different lipid types, suggesting specific lipid-lipid interactions that modulate protein-membrane contacts.
