===== Target Lipid Effects on Specific Lipid Types =====

Lipid Type: CHOL
  Effect Size (β): 2.567
  95% HDI: [2.208, 2.913]
  Probability of positive effect: 1.000
  Interpretation: Strong evidence that target lipid increases contact with this lipid type.

Lipid Type: DIPC
  Effect Size (β): 1.518
  95% HDI: [0.456, 2.504]
  Probability of positive effect: 0.997
  Interpretation: Strong evidence that target lipid increases contact with this lipid type.

Lipid Type: DPSM
  Effect Size (β): 1.177
  95% HDI: [0.679, 1.669]
  Probability of positive effect: 1.000
  Interpretation: Strong evidence that target lipid increases contact with this lipid type.

Lipid Type: DOPS
  Effect Size (β): -0.000
  95% HDI: [-0.000, 0.000]
  Probability of negative effect: 0.508
  Interpretation: Weak evidence for target lipid effect on this lipid type.


===== Overall Conclusions =====
Strong positive effects: 3 lipid types
Strong negative effects: 0 lipid types

Target lipid primarily increases contacts with other lipid types, suggesting cooperative lipid-lipid interactions.
