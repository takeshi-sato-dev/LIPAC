===== Bayesian Analysis Results =====

--- Model 1: Relationship between Target Lipid Contact and Protein Contact ---
Mean effect size (β): -0.7299
95% HDI: [-0.9028, -0.5549]
P(β < 0) = 1.0000

--- Model 2: Relationship between Target Lipid Contact and Lipid Contact ---
Mean effect size (β): 0.8051
95% HDI: [0.6228, 0.9865]
P(β > 0) = 1.0000

--- Effect Direction ---
P(Protein Effect < 0 and Lipid Effect > 0) = 1.0000

Conclusion: Target Lipid has a high probability of decreasing protein-protein contacts while simultaneously increasing lipid-protein contacts.
This result suggests that Target Lipid inhibits protein dimer formation through a competitive binding mechanism.
