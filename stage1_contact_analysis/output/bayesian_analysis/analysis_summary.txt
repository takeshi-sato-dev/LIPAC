1. Key Findings from Exploratory Analysis
------------------------
* Protein-protein contact difference (with target lipid vs without): t=-6.1644, p=3.0893e-09
* Lipid-protein contact difference (with target lipid vs without): t=0.2595, p=7.9548e-01
* Ratio difference (with target lipid vs without): t=-0.0131, p=9.8959e-01

Effects by Target Lipid Contact Strength:
* Protein contact difference (strong vs weak/no target lipid): t=-4.5021, p=1.0654e-04
* Strong target lipid mean: -1.0293
* Weak/no target lipid mean: -0.1068

2. Key Findings from Bayesian Regression Analysis
------------------------------
Protein Contact Model:
* Mean effect size (β): -0.7299
* 95% HDI: [-0.9028, -0.5549]
* P(β < 0) = 1.0000
* Mean effect size (β): 0.8051
* 95% HDI: [0.6228, 0.9865]

Lipid Contact Model:
* Mean effect size (β): 0.8051
* 95% HDI: [0.6228, 0.9865]
* P(β > 0) = 1.0000

Effect Direction:
* P(Protein Effect < 0 and Lipid Effect > 0) = 1.0000

Conclusion:
* This result suggests that Target Lipid inhibits protein dimer formation through a competitive binding mechanism.

3. Key Findings from Hierarchical Bayesian Model
--------------------------------
Global Effect:
* 95% HDI: [-2.0121, 0.5524]
* P(μ_β < 0) = 0.8835
* 95% HDI: [-0.9705, -0.6052]
* 95% HDI: [-2.4300, 1.8860]
* 95% HDI: [-5.0947, -2.1353]
* 95% HDI: [-1.0519, 0.9630]

Protein-Specific Effect Summary:
* Target Lipid effect (β) -0.7884: Probability of negative GM3 effect = 1.000
* Target Lipid effect (β) -3.6475: Probability of negative GM3 effect = 1.000

4. Overall Conclusion
------------
This result suggests that Target Lipid inhibits protein dimer formation through a competitive binding mechanism.
